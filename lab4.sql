SELECT *
from dealer
inner join client on dealer.id = client.dealer_id

--b) find all dealers along with client name, city, grade, sell number, date, and amount
Select client.dealer_id, client.name, client.city,client.priority,sell.id,sell.date,sell.amount
From client

--c) find the dealer and client who belongs to same city
Select dealer.name,client.name
from dealer
cross join client
where dealer.location = client.city

--b) find top 5 dates with the greatest total sell amount
create view greatest_amount(date,sum)

Select city,avg_tot_client.total,avg_tot_location.total
